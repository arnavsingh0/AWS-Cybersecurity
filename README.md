Welcome to our teamâ€™s repository and wiki for the COSC55 Final Project. This README will guide you through our project and wiki documentation.

## Repository Structure

All our project documentation is maintained in the GitHub wiki. Navigate to the wiki section and select the relevant page for detailed information. We have organized our content into modules:

- **Module 2:** System Design
- **Module 3:** Creation of Environment and Testing
- **Module 4:** Security Implementation Walkthrough and Security Technical Summary
- **Resources:** Initial and Final Resource Pages outlining our references and guides

## Project Overview

### Key Metrics:
- **12 AWS Resources Used**  
- **20+ Hours Spent on Implementation**  
- **Countless Challenges Overcome**  
- **2 of us Learning In-Depth AWS Knowledge**

### AWS Resources Utilized:
- EC2
- S3
- CloudTrail
- CloudWatch
- IAM
- KMS
- Lambda
- RDS
- VPC
- AWS Shield
- WAF
- AWS Certificate Manager

### Project Focus:
Our project centers around building a secure cloud environment for a hypothetical organization with an employee directory application. This project involves setting up secure data storage, access management, and monitoring, using a variety of AWS services.

Initially, we aimed to focus on encryption using Amazon KMS and IAM for strict user roles and access control, while leveraging CloudWatch and CloudTrail for logging and monitoring. However, due to challenges with learner account permissions, we adjusted our focus to include alternative AWS security solutions and still met our learning objectives.

## Project Reflection

As a team, we faced challenges, especially with limited permissions in our learner accounts, preventing us from using certain IAM features. This limitation forced us to adapt and find creative solutions using other AWS resources, which ultimately enhanced our project and deepened our understanding of cloud security.

Despite the setbacks, we successfully implemented several AWS security features, ensuring a robust and secure cloud environment for our hypothetical application. This experience taught us the importance of flexibility and problem-solving when working with cloud technologies.

## Conclusion

This project has been a valuable learning experience, providing us with practical skills in cloud computing, security, and AWS services. Our teamwork and adaptability allowed us to overcome challenges and deliver a secure cloud solution, preparing us for future endeavors in cloud security and beyond.

### Acknowledgments
